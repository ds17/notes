       "\n",
       "I purchased this delightful panda plush toy as a birthday gift for my daughter, who has a penchant for \"borrowing\" my belongings from my room. As an adult, I must admit that I too have fallen in love with this adorable creature. \n",
       "\n",
       "The first thing that struck me about this plush toy is its exceptional softness. It is an absolute pleasure to touch and hold, making it an irresistible companion for my daughter. She carries it with her everywhere she goes, and it never fails to bring a smile to her face.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, I did notice a minor flaw in the design. One of the ears appears to be slightly lower than the other, which I believe was not intended to be asymmetrical. While this does not detract from the overall charm of the toy, it is worth mentioning.\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of size, I must admit that I expected a slightly larger toy considering its price. It would be beneficial for the manufacturer to offer larger options at the same price point, as this would provide customers with more choices.\n",
       "\n",
       "On a positive note, the delivery of the plush toy exceeded my expectations. It arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me the opportunity to experience its softness and cuteness firsthand before presenting it to my daughter.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, despite a minor design flaw and the desire for a larger size option, this panda plush toy is undeniably a delightful gift for individuals of all ages. Its softness, cuteness, and universal appeal make it a must-have for any panda enthusiast."

In the traditional transaction model, there is a lack of sufficient trust and communication among the various stakeholders, resulting in a loose connection of project operations. Furthermore, in order to transfer risks for personal gain, a series of problems such as change claims, delays in project completion, and cost overruns occur during the implementation of engineering projects. Therefore, it is imperative to innovate project delivery models."

       "介绍：非侵入性脑部刺激的两种方法，经颅磁刺激（TMS）和经颅直流电刺激（tDCS），已经证明对认知有积极的影响，并且可以改善抑郁等神经精神症状。对于常见的神经退行性疾病，这些方法的疗效了解较少。在本综述中，我们评估了TMS和tDCS对主要痴呆症（包括阿尔茨海默病（AD）、血管性痴呆（VaD）、帕金森病伴痴呆（PDD）、前额颞叶痴呆（FTD）和帕金森病（PD）的潜在前痴呆状态轻度认知障碍（MCI）和帕金森病（PD））的认知和神经精神症状的影响。\n",
       "\n",
       "方法：在PubMed（截至2014年2月7日）和PsycINFO（从1967年到2014年1月第3周）数据库中进行半系统性搜索，以确定相关的治疗研究。共找到762项研究，其中包括18项痴呆症研究和14项PD人群研究。\n",
       "\n",
       "结果：未在PDD、FTD或VaD患者中找到任何研究。在痴呆症方面，有13项研究是在AD患者中进行的，1项是在DLB患者中进行的，还有4项是在MCI患者中进行的。在这18项研究中，有16项显示出至少一项认知或神经精神结果的改善。在14项针对PD患者的研究中，有12项观察到认知或神经精神改善。\n",
       "\n",
       "结论：TMS和tDCS可能作为治疗与痴呆和PD相关症状的干预手段具有潜力。这些结果是令人鼓舞的；然而，现有数据有限，特别是在VaD、PDD和FTD方面，同时在最大化这两种技术的疗效和临床效用方面存在重大挑战。特别是，刺激参数在研究之间存在相当大的差异，这可能会对治疗效果产生影响。\n",
